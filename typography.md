Johannes Gutenberg and the printing press. [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Gutenberg)

Most of us know what alphanumeric characters look like on an instinctual level: _a_, _b_, _c_, ..., etc.

And machines know too these days as a result of optical character recognition (OCR).

We recognize characters when we see them. But the same characters often vary — due to different fonts and different styles of handwriting.

So what do humans and machines "think of" when they think of a particular character?

Furthermore, what is the "canonical representation" of a character?

In light of these questions, I decided to create a font that is intuitive enough that anyone can understand how each character is designed — and therefore anyone can reproduce.

I call it Relatia, after _relationship_, and it's available here at FontStruct.

Here is an example.

It's quite simple, right?

As a result, it's more abstract and also more universal. You do not need the font file to use it; you can recreate it yourself!

## Aside on Unicode

On the topic of canonical representations of characters, the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) standard might come to mind.

In addition to the numeric codes that it assigns to characters, Unicode has visualizations of them for reference.

So what font do you think that Unicode uses for the English alphabet?

Times New Roman?

Arial?

It turns out that Unicode uses a font named _Fiscella_, created by John M. Fiscella at Production First Software.

I found [references](https://web.archive.org/web/19980126170356/http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/u2fonts.html) to Fiscella being used for Unicode as far back as 1998 on the Wayback Machine.

You can also see for yourself on the Unicode website by downloading the [chart](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf) for the English alphabet, opening it with Adobe Acrobat, and inspecting _Document properties_ > _Fonts_.

I'm often interested by how conventions originate and develop — especially when they are unexpected!
