I am a graduate student in data science at the University of Pennsylvania.

I received a B.S. in computer science with departmental honors from Vanderbilt University.

My interests are data science and machine learning.

## What is Information Gain?

It's a quantity used to train [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) as well as to measure the distance between probability distributions.

A simple interpretation is that it quantifies how much information is gained by using a particular variable.

It also describes my curiosity in life, so I think it's a good title for my blog.
