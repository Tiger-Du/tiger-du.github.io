### SE-PINN

[Webpage](sepinn) | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Tiger-Du/SE-PINN)

__Summary__: The mathematical properties of normality, symmetry, and orthogonality are integrated into a neural network itself via a custom loss function and a custom architectural layer in PyTorch so that its predictions respect these properties by design.

__Graphic__: This is an animation of how the predictions of a model change as it is trained. Visit the repository to view the same animation for a less naive model that respects exact symmetry.
