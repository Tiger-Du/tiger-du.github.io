Virgil reading the Aeneid. [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Virgil_Reading_the_Aeneid.jpg)
:::

Besides research and typography, I am also interested in natural language.

Poetry in particular interested me during my childhood, and I was often amazed by the creative use of both _rhyming_ and _meter_.

It's perhaps no wonder that I now spend a lot of my time coding.

It's also noteworthy that poetry has become a popular test of how capable a language model is.

Here are two poems that I composed before college — both about the outdoors, which is another of my pastimes. They are quite melodramatic, but so is most poetry that I know of!

Besides rhyming and meter, see whether you can identify the uses of assonance, consonance, and alliteration.

## Day and Night

Day is born with mellow light. \
Nascent gods blind naught in sight. \
Mild sun of soft repose... \
Mild sky of pleasant glows... \
Morning bridles daylight’s might.

Midday rouses ardent flame. \
Passion burns what does fall lame. \
Fervent fire on the turf... \
Fervent luster on the surf... \
Full grown daylight—all but tame.

Hues of anguish shroud the scene. \
Heaven flares with shameful sheen. \
Painted sky for painful woes... \
Painted clouds for painful throes... \
Welkin blood hails fair Selene.

Night descends on drowsy eyes. \
Darkness lies on onyx skies. \
Silver moon in frigid air... \
Silver stars in midnight’s lair... \
At this hour daylight dies—.

## Nature

Crystal breezes wander by; \
Fond embrace harks nature’s sigh. \
Lift do Mother’s breaths the sky... \
To lead life and essence nigh.

Wooded forest, full of sound... \
Home to holy birds abound... \
Sing do card’nals, crimson crowned; \
Soar do euphonies unbound.

Ripples in the quiet creek... \
Under the cliff’s earthen peak... \
Breathe do rivers silent speak. \
Yet do rapids chaos wreak.

Sylvan souls quest plain ideal; \
At the forest floor, they kneel. \
Seek do gentle insects meal. \
Dash do creatures forth per zeal.
